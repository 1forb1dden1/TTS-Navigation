# IOS Mobile Aid for the Visually Imapired
This mobile app will act as an interface for a bluetooth device attached to a walking cane that will be used to collect data for localization. 

The reason that localization is so important for the visually impaired is because of the difficulty they have with access.

This application will implement a interface that the Visually Impaired can interact with powered by a Text to Speech system. 

# Goal
Feed data to a machine learning model that can help the visually impaired access things as we can access. We hope that one day visually impaired and even blind people can travel the world independently just like everyone else can. 

# Features
1. Text to Speech with the speech component of the expo framework. 
2. Redirection to other pages with React Navigation.
3. Tappable screen with the <Pressable> feature of react native for ease of use. 

# Things to Implement
1. Bluetooth pairing.
2. Access Camera.
3. Phone Location and google Maps. 
4. Voice control. 
5. Move back to previous page.
